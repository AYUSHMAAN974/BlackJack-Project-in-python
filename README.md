# Blackjack Game in Python

## Introduction
This is a simple console-based implementation of the popular card game **Blackjack**, developed in Python. The game allows a user to play against a virtual dealer, adhering to the standard rules of Blackjack.

## Features
- Play Blackjack with a virtual dealer.
- The game follows basic rules, including "Hit" and "Stand" options.
- Random card generation to simulate a real deck of cards.

## Rules of the Game
1. The goal is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer without exceeding 21 (busting).
2. Cards 2-10 are worth their face value.
3. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points.
4. An Ace can be worth 1 or 11, depending on which benefits the player more.
5. The player can choose to "Hit" (take another card) or "Stand" (keep their current hand).
6. The dealer must draw until their hand value is at least 17.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x

## Future Improvements
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
- Include multiplayer support.
